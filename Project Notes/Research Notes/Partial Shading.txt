Partial Shading - the effect of an object obstructing energy absorption by a pv system

A brief recap of electrical measurements
Volt - unit of force (as in F = ma)
	*force of electricity
Amps - current (x electrons pass through the curcit in y amount of seconds)
	*amount of electricity
Watts - energy per time unit
	*equal to amount x force, or W = V * AMP

From these equations ^^, it stands that a pv system would prefer AMOUNT of electricity to force of electricity, because it is storing it and not using it. Therefore, pv systems aim to optimize AMPS.

When a panel is obstructed, it is possible that the inverter will ignore such a panel to avoid lowering the system's current flow. However, an inverter may accept the shaded panel(s) if they happened to be generating more Amps than the completely unobstructed panel.

SolarEdge proposes that every panel be treated as its own independant system, so that no panel is ignored just because another panel within its system is underperforming. The result is a 5-20% energy gain from the system.

The article "Modeling and simulation of PV... based on a 2-diode model"  shows that the way solar modules are networked can affect which panels are used by the inverter. More connections brings about a larger chance that the system will harness more amps
