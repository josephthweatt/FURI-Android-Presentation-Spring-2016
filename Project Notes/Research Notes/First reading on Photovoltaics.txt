Solar Panels
------------
-use silicon, which is a semiconductor
-silicon has 4 valence electrons, which can bind to other silicon atoms
-boron connected to silicon creates one open valence electron, making a hole in the molecular structure. These holes are called CARRIERS, and move like bubbles in liquid across the solar panel.
-DOPING - intentionally introducing impurities into the material to modulate electrical properties

Solar panels consist of 5 layers
	*glass protectant
	*Front contact
	*n-doped layer
		!axis of electrons
	*p-doped layer
		!axis of protons
	*back contact

-n & p layers cross subatomic particles creating a barrier not permitting electrons to pass into the p-doped layer

-sunlight striking these layers cause electrons and protons to move past these layers, creating imbalance in layers. 
-Free electrons try to combine, but electrical field does not allow it. Electrons can be diverted through wires to power objects and complete a circut

-Inverter creates AC out of solar electricity, which is then measured and distributed along a grid.

How panels absorb light
-----------------------
band gap - min energy required to excite an electron stuck in the bound state into a state where it becomes conductive
-Sunlight may either be reflected off the protectant (glass), be absorbed in the material, or pass through the material. If the light is not absorbed, the solar energy is wasted, and will not be converted to electricity

-Key determinant of absorption is the energy that photons possess. 
-Three equations pertaining to light absorption:
	Given: Eph = energy of photon  && Eg = band gap energy
	if Eph < Eg
		photons pass through as if they are transparent
	if Eph = Eg
		photons are efficiently absorbed
	if Eph > Eg
		photons are absorbed STRONGLY, but their strength is not fully harnessed as the photons travel past the point of absorption

-photons travel horiziontally across the conduction band
-the distance it takes for a photon to reach the conduction band is called the absorption coeficient
	*coefficient dependant upon the type of material used and the strength of the wavelength. 
	*Materials affect the coefficient
	*shorter wavelength means greater coefficient

Commercial Information about solar panels
-Solar panel wattage describes the approx amount of energy generated by the panel in one hour of peak conditions(ex. 255-Watt panel generates 255 watts during noon, assuming the panel works perfectly and is not obstructed by shade)

-Solar panel efficiencies descirbe the various wavelengths a solar panel is capable of harnessing for energy. Modern solar panels have efficiencies ranging from 20% (low end) to 40% (high end)
