-need to tweak equation to get proper sunrise/sunset schedules. Must do this before continuing to the rest of the equations. For future reference, the url of the main resource is:
	http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/calculation-of-solar-insolation
-oh, and I see that there is a more reliable equation for sunrise/set on that same page. I'll do it tomorrow, I need to sleep.

-woke up, think i figured out the sunrise/set equation. Use this for declination:

-Also, divide arccos by 15, make every trig function use degrees, and add the result by one (to account for 12:00 am in the day)
