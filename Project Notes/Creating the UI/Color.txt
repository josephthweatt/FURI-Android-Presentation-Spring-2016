Here's a look at the market research on company color schemes:

yellow/gold - optimism, clarity, warmth
orange - friendly, cheerful, confidence
red - excitement, youthful, both
pink/purple - creative, imaginitive, wise
blue - trust, dependable, strength
green - peaceful, growth, health
white/gray - balance, neutral, calm

I'm thinking of Having this scheme
Primary: Yellow
Secondary: Sky Blue
Detail: Green

This way, one see's a kind of terrestrial scape throughout the display. The color order, would thus follow this order:
-Blue at very top
-Yellow second-top
-more blue
-touches of green on the bottom

And we ommit brown, because nobody in their right mind wants to see the color brown in a app.

Logo would immitate the sun, with touches of blue. We can think of this once we have a name.
